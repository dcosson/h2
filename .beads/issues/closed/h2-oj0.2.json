  "description": "Implement inheritance chain resolution in internal/config/role.go for LoadRoleRenderedFrom and LoadRoleWithNameResolution, including cycle detection, depth limit, and global-role-only parent resolution. Build dual var definition views (renderDefs and exposedDefs), perform two-pass rendering across chain, and deep-merge ancestor-\u003edescendant YAML with documented scalar/map/list/null semantics. Add/extend role tests to cover single-level/multi-level inheritance, parent-not-found, depth overflow, unknown var handling against exposed contract, and AgentName two-pass behavior through inheritance.",
