  "description": "Kill the legacy Claude JSONL fallback path in peek.go (lines 56-64). Remove ClaudeCodeSessionLogPath from SessionMetadata struct and from daemon.go where it's computed. The Claude adapter's session log collector already owns this path internally via SetSessionLogPath. Peek now reads from the event store as primary path — the legacy fallback is dead code for adapted agents.",
