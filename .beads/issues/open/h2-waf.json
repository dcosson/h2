  "description": "Reviewer found that agent/agent.go and collector/collector.go re-export State, SubState, constants, StateUpdate, and FormatStateLabel from monitor via type aliases. CLAUDE.md says not to leave shims/re-exports. Update all ~30 callers across session.go, heartbeat.go, daemon.go, client/render.go, tests, etc. to import from monitor directly. Also add String() to AgentEventType for consistency, and remove duplicate FormatStateLabel tests from collector_test.go.",
