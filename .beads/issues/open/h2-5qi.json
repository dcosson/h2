  "title": "Fix eventstore Tail partial line handling",
  "description": "Reviewer found that eventstore Tail can lose partial lines: ReadBytes discards partial data on EOF, losing the start of events that were partially written. Fix by accumulating partial data across poll ticks. Also change Open from O_RDWR to O_WRONLY since reads use separate handles. Low practical risk but a correctness issue.",
